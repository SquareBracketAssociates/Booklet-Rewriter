For example, if I would deprecate a method:

```Smalltalk
	isEnabled: aBoolean
		isEnabled:= aBoolean```

I might want to have 3 cases:
- The value is "true", then replace by `enabled`
- The value us false, then replace by `disabled`
- the value is an expression that need to be executed at runtime to find the boolean, replace by `expression ifFalse: [ self disabled ]` (if the default value is true)

 replace: '`@receiver isEnable: true' with: '`@receiver enabled';
 replace: '`@receiver isEnable: false' with: '`@receiver disabled';
 replace: '`@receiver isEnable: `@arg' with: '`@arg ifTrue: [ `@receiver enabled ] ifFalse: [ `@receiver disabled ]';
